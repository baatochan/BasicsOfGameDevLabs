Few very simple games written in Construct during Computer Games Development course (Projektowanie gier komputerowych 1) at the university.

Beside those two simple games in Construct the repo contains two slideshows that were needed to be made at this course.

The slideshows are about two games:
* T-Rex Chrome Game
* Slime Rancher

Their purpose was to look at the game from a developer perspective and describe every aspect of the game that is important when creating own game.
